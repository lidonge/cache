**Distributed Caching System**

The system consists of three main components: Source End, Client End, and Center.

* **Source End**: Responsible for storing business data. When data changes, it notifies the Center about which keys have been updated.
* **Client End**: The consumer of data. When a client needs to use data associated with a certain key, it first checks its local cache. If the local cache doesn't have the data or it's stale, it will retrieve the data from the Center. And if the Center also doesn't have the data, it will query the Source End for the latest data.
* **Center**: Receives requests from clients and:
	+ Checks if its local cache is stale (dirty). If it is, returns an empty response.
	+ If the local cache is not stale, returns the current cached value.
	+ When receiving update notifications from the Source End, marks its local cache as invalid.

**Distribution and Consensus**

When multiple clients have their own caches, there's a risk of partitioning inconsistencies. To address this, the system follows the CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance).

* The Center receives updates and notifies each relevant client.
* Each client acknowledges the update before considering it consensus.
* Both clients and the Center maintain a "consensus-in-progress" status until consensus is reached.
